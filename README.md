## Hey, I'm Kleosr 👋

Full stack & AI engineer · Cursor Ambassador.  

Security, performance, and clean systems thinking drive everything shipped here — from low-level Linux tuning to AI‑native developer tooling.  

I design silent systems where human creativity directs artificial intelligence, not the other way around.  
Security is part of the design, not an afterthought.  

## What this repo is

- Code and configs that power the minimal, terminal‑inspired site at https://kleosr.surge.sh  
- Static‑first portfolio surface with explicit service tiers, infra overview, and a small engineering archive  

## What you can expect

- Opinionated defaults for AI‑native development, with security and maintainability treated as core constraints  
- Real‑world artifacts.

## Work with me

If you need a system built or upgraded, open an issue or reach out directly and include: scope, constraints, and any hard deadlines.  
Clear constraints mean faster, safer software with less rework.
